The app is a recipe lister / finder designed to let users search for what they feel like eating and/or have in their pantry to use up the ingredients.

The greeting bar will change according to the time to morning/afternoon/evening and the food recommendations will change accordingly as well.

Please select the recipe you want by clicking on it's picture. That will bring up the recipe. I have deisgned it using a checkbox so that the user may check off steps that they have completed.

Clicking on the "Get ingredient list" will open a new tab containing the ingredient list for the user to go shopping. Usual pantry items like water, salt, sugar, etc is ignored so the list can be comprehensive and not miss out anything.
